# Project Details
- The project uses JavaScript alone to generate the entire contents of the website.
- The project uses webpack to organise and simplify project building. 
- Each section in the navigation bar is generated by a module located in the src/components folder. 
- Each module exports a function that creates a div element, including each HTML tag and CSS Id and classes that will render the expected view.
- The file src/index.js build the tab-switching logic. Event listeners will be attached to each navigation menu item, that will further fire the correct function.
- As per requirements, each function will wipe-out the previously rendered HTML tags, and dynamically regenerate the required content for the selected menu item. 

## Built With

- HTML/CSS, Javascript, Webpack, NPM, yarn.
- ESlint, Stylelint
- VSCode
